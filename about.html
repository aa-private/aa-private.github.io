<p>Which technology is the most powerful medium for social change? (i) a firearm, (ii) money, (iii) a pen.</p>

<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, writing is a superpower. A cost-free weapon of mass disruption. Revolutions are brought about with the pen. Peace treaties are signed with a pen. It is the great democratizer and equalizer. All of us have this powerful weapon at the tip of our fingers with which we can reach every corner of the world and fight without casualties. Writing is immune to the passage of time. We can use it to fight for justice, equality and freedom. We can use it to fight against discrimination, coercion and inequalities. We can use it to educate and share knowledge. You name it. Whatever your fight is, our feelings and desires for change can all be expressed through writing. Everyone writes for their own reasons, and the ones that move me the most are laid out in this blog.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. Writing is difficult. Writing takes time. Yet time is the very thing we all have so little of. In our busy and packed lives, most of us have no time for self-reflection. Writing requires pressing pause on the chaos of life and simply taking the time to think and ponder. It requires stepping back from the daily headlines and breaking news alerts to widen our view and draw lessons. It requires discipline and restraint from pithy speech wars on social media, 140 character tweets, selfies, emojis, and superficial soundbites and comments on facebook <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.  It requires articulating thoughts intelligibly and in detail for everyone to understand.</p>

<p>Has blogging really fallen out of fashion? I beg to differ. In the face of social media, blogs still serve its original purpose as a platform to voice ideas, thoughts, and feelings. I am, defiantly, returning to the old way of sharing, learning, arguing, and reading. We can do better.</p>

<p>When I come to begin a post, it is usually with a question in mind, something I have been thinking about and I want to discuss. I often don't care as much for the answer than I care for the question itself. I am sharing personal thoughts, observations, and things I have read on a wide variety of issues ranging from social criticism and commentary, to my most deeply-held beliefs about science, morality, and our human condition. Particularly when they are pertinent to ideals I hold dear.</p>

<p>Here lays before you my modest attempt to bring more thoughtful writing into the world. I am putting forward ideas, some of which might seem opinionated or off-beat, and some that few are ready to hear. You may disagree with me at times, but I will always do my best to defend my views with arguments. My hope remains that I will make you think at least a little bit about what you do actually believe in, and that in some way it will benefit you.</p>

<p>This blog will certainly not change the world, but it sure will change me. At best it might impact just one person, who in turn may change the world. And that seems reason enough to try.</p>
